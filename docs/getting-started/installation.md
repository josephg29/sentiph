# Installation

Sentiph is a local Node.js project with a local API and web UI.

## Requirements

- Node.js `22+`
- `claude` for the supported workflow
- `git` for worktree terminals
- `gh` for GitHub pull request features
- `curl` for the current Claude hook callback flow

The current docs are Claude Code-first. Some provider plumbing exists in the codebase, but it is not the supported story yet.

## Local development install

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

## Local global CLI install from a clone

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm build
npm install -g .
```

## npm registry install

Sentiph is not published to the npm registry yet, so `npm install -g sentiph` will fail with `404`.

## First run behavior

Running `sentiph` inside a project directory will:

- create `.sentiph/` if it does not exist
- add `.sentiph` to `.gitignore` or create `.gitignore` when it is missing
- write a stable project ID to `.sentiph/project.json`
- register the project under `~/.sentiph/projects.json`
- move runtime state to `~/.sentiph/projects/<project-id>/state/`
- choose an open local API port starting at `8787`
- open the browser unless `SENTIPH_NO_OPEN=1`
- show a Deck setup card until the first session is created

## Startup rules

- startup fails if neither `claude` nor another supported provider binary is available
- startup warns when optional integrations like `git`, `gh`, or `curl` are missing
